                <li><strong>Introduction:</strong>
                    <p>In 1982, William T. Reeves, a researcher at Lucasfilm Ltd., was working on the film <em>Star
                        Trek II: The Wrath of
                        Khan</em>. Much of the movie revolves
                        around the Genesis Device, a torpedo that when shot at a barren, lifeless planet has the ability
                        to reorganize
                        matter and create a habitable world for
                        colonization. During the sequence, a wall of fire ripples over the planet while it is being
                        'terraformed'. The term
                        <strong><em>particle system</em></strong>, an incredibly common and useful technique in computer
                        graphics, was
                        coined in the creation of this particular
                        effect.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>
                            "A particle system is a collection of many many minute particles that together represent a
                            fuzzy object. Over a
                            period of time, particles are generated
                            into a system, move and change from within the system, and die from the system."
                        </em>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This type of effect is commonly replicated and re-produced using particle systems in games,
                        graphics, movies etc.
                        Examples of such effects include fire,
                        rain, snow, sand, waterfalls, stars, galaxies, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Particle system can also be used to depict hair or fur, by rendering the entire lifetime of a
                        single particle at
                        once, which can be manipulated as per the
                        interaction with the environment.

                <li><strong>Building a simple Particle System:</strong></li>
                <p>
                    From the definition mentioned above, it is easy to tell that a particle system is just a
                    container of individual
                    independent elements, which have their own
                    properties/attributes and each interact with their environment, and as a whole produce a desired
                    effect. This
                    behavior can be reproduced quite easily via
                    code using Object Oriented Programming principles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We intend to demonstrate the creation of a simple particle system using Processing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our goal is to make a particle system container, a class, which when called would display a
                    screen full of
                    particles, without the need of directly
                    referencing/initializing any individual particles.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><em>A single particle</em></li>
                    <p>
                        First, we will try and describe a single particle. What would it look like? What are its basic
                        attributes? And then
                        wrap them into a single component, a class.
                    </p>
<pre>
class Particle {
  PVector location;                     // Vector storing the location of the particle
  PVector velocity;                     // Vector stores velocity
  PVector acceleration;                 // Vector stores acceleration
  Float lifespan;                       // The duration that the particle ‘lives’

  Particle(PVector l) {
    location = l.get();                                     //Stores x and y co-ordinates when particle is initialized
    velocity = new PVector(random(-1,1), random(-2, 0));    // Particle will either go left or right and upward direction.
    acceleration = new PVector(0, 0.02);                    // Will have a downward acceleration (gravity)
    lifespan = 255;                                         // Can be chosen as per required effect
  }

  void update() {
    velocity.add(acceleration);
    location.add(velocity);             // Here the velocity and acceleration change the location of // this particle
    lifespan -= 2.0;                    // each time the particle is updated it ‘grows older’
  }

  void display() {
    stroke(0);
    fill(175);
    ellipse(location.x,location.y,8,8);         // For now we consider our particle as a circle
  }
}</pre>
                    <li><em>ArrayList and Iterator Class</em></li>
<pre>
ArrayList&lt;Particle&gt; particles;

void setup() {
  size(640,360);
  particles = new ArrayList&lt;Particle&gt;();
}

void draw() {
  background(255);

  particles.add(new Particle(new PVector(width/2,50)));

  Iterator&lt;Particle&gt; it = particles.iterator();
  //[full] Using an Iterator object instead of counting with int i
  while (it.hasNext()) {
    Particle p = it.next();
    p.run();
    if (p.isDead()) {
       it.remove();
    }
  }
}
</pre>
                    <video width="400" height="300" controls align="center">

                    <p>
                        That was a single particle, but we need our code to organize the data to accommodate many many
                        such particles. One
                        way of doing this is using the ArrayList
                        - we can simply add a particle with every call to draw().
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another thing to note is the isDead() function - if we were to keep adding particles to the
                        system, after a while we
                        would see the frame rate slow down and
                        eventually seemingly halts because of the sheer number of particles. Here, the remove() function
                        of the ArrayList is
                        extremely useful i.e. remove the
                        particle whose lifeSpan has elapsed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We can also look at using the Iterator class to loop through the particles making sure each
                        particle is updated
                        correctly.
                    </p>
                    <li><em>Encapsulate it all into a Class</em></li>
<pre>
class ParticleSystem {
  ArrayList particles;
  // This particular ParticleSystem implementation
  // includes an origin point where each Particle begins.
  PVector origin;

  ParticleSystem(PVector location) {
    origin = location.get();
    particles = new ArrayList();
  }

  void addParticle() {
    // The origin is passed to each Particle when it is added.
    particles.add(new Particle(origin));
  }</pre>
                    <li><em>Applying a Force</em></li>
                    <p>
                        Now that we have a simple Particle system built, we would also like it to react to external
                        forces. We do this by
                        looping through the list of particles
                        applying the force on each one.
                    </p>
<pre>
Void applyForce( Pvector force) {
   For(Particle p : particles){
    p.applyForce(f);
    }
}</pre>
                    <p>
                        And within the particle , in accordance to Newton's law of motion, update the acceleration using
                        the mass (For now
                        consider, mass = 1, randomize this to
                        achieve different results).
                    </p>
<pre>
Void applyForce(PVector force){
   PVector f = new force.get();
   f.div(mass); // consider the mass = 1 for a particle, can be changed for
                // different results
   acceleration.add(f);
}
</pre>
                    <li><em>Adding Texture </em></li>
                    <p>
                        Adding a simple texture such as the one below, with appropriate color (tint), our system looks
                        like smoke or fire.

                <p>
                    In the previous section, we saw a working Particle System capable of reproducing recognizable
                    special effects;
                    albeit quite simple looking effects but
                    special effects nonetheless.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is one of the main impetus of this paper that the myriads of complex systems that we are used
                    to seeing in
                    various 3d softwares are inherently built
                    on something very basic and easy to understand. If one were to sit down and expand the workings of
                    our particle
                    system by including things such as
                    interactions between particles, evolution of particles (with time or environment), dynamic stimuli
                    etc. it would
                    more realistically depict the systems that
                    are used in the industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also highly recommend the use of artist friendly 3d softwares like Maya and Houdini, to
                    experience the extent
                    of
                    sophistication to which one can take a
                    particle system.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Particle systems can be created and modified natively in many 3D modeling and rendering packages
                    including
                    Cinema
                    4D, Lightwave, Houdini, Maya, XSI, 3D
                    Studio Max and Blender.
